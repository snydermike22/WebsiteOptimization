These are things I did to optimize my page. Keep scrolling and Read below for specifics

1.  Watched a office hours with Mark over and over and over. Literally 10 times until I understood it.
2.  Took suggestions from office hours, read the Udacity forums.  Asked questions to many other students
3.  went to https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ and put in my code from index.html and pizza.html and listened to all of their suggestions.
4.  Some things I did.  Inlined my css, asnyc'd my javascript compressed picture sizes, Moved Javascript to reduce render blocking.
	Minified my javascript.
5.  Google, Google, google, google, and when I was done googled some more.  Then I googled.
6.  I commented all my code where I made my changes so the instructor can review where I did what I did.

List of Main.js Changes.

1. Moved element selector into global variables

2. Moved a few things out of the for loop to make it run faster, didnt need to get the randomPizzaContainer, dx or the newwidth each time in the loop.

3. Moved the outside the loop also.  So it doesnt do it 100x only once. 
var pizzasDiv = document.getElementById("randomPizzas");

4. Moves the sliding background pizzas based on scroll position

5. Moved items out of function so it only gets called once

6. Moved a calculation out of the loop

7. Instead of style.left changed it to style.transform = "translate3d(".  Per office hours suggestion

  var cols = 5;
  var s = 256;

9. Changed it to 30 in the below loop from 200, per office hours suggestion.  Doesnt need to go all the way to 200
  for (var i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
